      N.B.â€”There is a point of some technical interest to be noted in this
      play. The customary division into acts and scenes has been disused, and a
      return made to unity of time and place, as observed in the ancient Greek
      drama. In the foregoing tragedy, The Doctor's Dilemma, there are five
      acts; the place is altered five times; and the time is spread over an
      undetermined period of more than a year. No doubt the strain on the
      attention of the audience and on the ingenuity of the playwright is much
      less; but I find in practice that the Greek form is inevitable when drama
      reaches a certain point in poetic and intellectual evolution. Its adoption
      was not, on my part, a deliberate display of virtuosity in form, but
      simply the spontaneous falling of a play of ideas into the form most
      suitable to it, which turned out to be the classical form. Getting
      Married, in several acts and scenes, with the time spread over a long
      period, would be impossible.
